          {`I was an Event Coordinator working at a boutique hotel in NYC, and whenever we scheduled an event, we would take a dry-erase marker, walk up to a giant calendar in our office wall, and write in the event name and details, like start time/end time, and number of guests.A giant calendar in the office was an “interesting” way to keep our events and clients organized, but I thought to myself: “there has to be a better way!” That’s where the idea for “Plannit” started. The goal was to create an app that would help event coordinators and planners organized with their upcoming events.`}
