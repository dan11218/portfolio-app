          <p>{`I would have to say Plannit (link). It was the first time I put my self in the shoes of a founder by coming up with an original concept. I architected the entire road map for development and led developers through the agile process, organized brainstorming sessions, and designed wireframes based on our findings. I loved this project for the experiences I gained from working in a team and to build a product that solves an important problem for event planners, which resonates with me as a previous event coordinator.`}</p>

          <p>{`Notion has been my secret weapon in my career, because of itâ€™s easy-to-use interface, and that it gives me the ability to quickly create pages, databases, and organize my data and thoughts. The biggest feature that makes it stand out from other text editors is the ability to easily manipulate and move around blocks of text without having to select to highlight text manually with your cursor. Such action can actually lead to inaccurate formatting and leads to my (and others) frustration.`}</p>
