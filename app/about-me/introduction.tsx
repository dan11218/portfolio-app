              I&apos;m a UX Designer based in Queens, New York. I found my
              passion for design and software when I was an Event Coordinator
              working at a boutique hotel in NYC.

            <p>
              One day, I had an idea for an app that would help planners stay
              organised and solve some of the pain points I felt in my
              experience. I wanted to learn more about software development on
              both the engineering and design sides of the process.

              When I&apos;m not working, I&apos;m either cooking, reading
              poetry, gaming/streaming, or trying out new restaurants NYC with
              my partner. I&apos;m also working on an indie-horror game built in
              Godot.
